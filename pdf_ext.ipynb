John Hutchins [1]. In 1990, the first \\ntranslator workstations came to the market. Finally, in the last five years or so, MT has become an online service \\non the Internet. [2, 3]  \\nThe term machine translation (MT) is translation of one language to  another.

Unresolved \\nreferences can lead to incorrect translation [7].  \\nIdioms  \\nAn idiomatic expression may convey a different meaning, that what is evident from its words. For \\nexample, an idiom in English language „No brick in their walls‟, would not convey the intend meaning when \\ntranslated into Hindi language [7].  \\nAmbiguity  \\nIn computational linguistics, Word Sense disambiguation (WSD) is an open problem of natural language \\nprocessing, which governs the process of identifying which sense of a word (i.e. meaning) is used in a sentence, \\nwhen the word has multiple meanings [7].  \\n \\nII.    PROCESS OF MACHINE TRANSLATION \\nMachine translation is the process of translating from source language text into the target language. The \\nfollowing diagram shows all the phases involved.  \\nFig. 1 A Typical Machine Translation Process  \\nText Input  \\nThis is the first phase in the machine translation process and is the first module in any MT system. The sentence \\ncategories can be classified based on the degree of difficulty of translation. Sentences that have relations, \\nexpectations, assumptions, and conditions make the MT system understand very difficult. Speaker‟s intentions \\nand mental status expressed in the sentences require discourse analysis for interpretation. This is due to the inter -\\nrelationship among adjacent sentences. World knowl edge and commonsense knowledge could be required for \\ninterpreting some sentences.  \\nDeformating and reformatting  \\nThis is to make the machine translation process easier and qualitative. The source language text may contain \\nfigures, flowcharts, etc that do not require any translation. So only translation portions should be identified. Once \\nthe text is translated the target text is to be reformatted after post-editing. Reformatting is to see that the target text \\nalso contains the non-translation portion.  \\nPre-editing and Post editing  \\nThe level of pre-editing and post-editing depend on the efficiency of the particular MT system. For some systems \\nsegmenting the long sentences into short sentences may be required. Fixing up punctuation marks and blocking \\nmaterial that does not require trarnslation are also done during pre -editing. Post editing is done to make sure that \\nthe quality of the translation is upto the mark. Post-editing is unavoidable  \\nespecially for translation of crucial information such as one for hea lth. Post-editing should continue till the MT \\nsystems reach the human-like.  \\nAnalysis, Transfer and Generation  \\nMorphological analysis determines the word form such as inflections, tense, number, part of speech, etc. \\nSyntactic analysis determines whether the word is subject or object. Semantic and contextual analysis determine a \\nproper interpretation of a sentence from the results produced by the syntactic analysis. Syntactic and semantic \\nanalysis are often executed simultaneously and produce syntactic tree  structure and semantic network \\nrespectively. This results in internal structure of a sentence. The sentence generation phase is just reverse of the \\nprocess of analysis.  \\nMorphological analysis and generation  \\nComputational morphology deals with recognition, analysis and generation of words. Some of the morphological \\nprocess are inflection, derivation, affixes and combining forms. Inflection is the most regular and productive \\nmorphological process across languages. Inflection alters the form of the word in number, gender, mood, tense, \\naspect, person, and case. Morphologicalanalyzer gives information concerning morphological properties of the \\nwords it analyses.  \\nSyntactic analysis and generation  \\nAs words are the foundation of speech and language processing, syntax can considered as the skeleton. Syntactic \\nanalysis concerns with how words are grouped into classes called parts-of-speech, how they group their neighbors \\ninto phrases, and the way in which words depends on other words in a sentence.  \\nGrammar formalism  \\nGrammar formalism is a framework to explain the basic structure of a language. Researchers propose the \\nfollowing grammar formalisms:  \\nPhrase Structure Grammar (PSG) Dependency Grammar Case Grammar Systematic Grammar Montague \\nGrammar  \\nThe variants of PSG are'),\n",

PSG, for example, does suit Japanese while dependency grammar \\ndoes suite. Case grammar is popular as sentence in differet languages that express the same contents may have the \\nsame case frames.  \\nParsing and Tagging  \\nTagging means the identification of linguistic properties of the individual words and parsing is the assessment of \\nthe functions of the words in relation to eah other.  \\nSemantic and Contextual analysis and Generation  \\nSemantic analysis composes the meaning representations and assigns them the linguisticinputs. The semantic \\nanalyzers use lexicon and grammar to create context independent meanings. The source of knowledge consists of \\nmeaning of words, meanings associated with grammatical structures, knowledge about the discourse c ontext and \\ncommonsense knowledge.  \\n \\nIII.   APPROACHES IN MACHINE TRANSALTION \\nThe MT systems can broadly be categorized on the basis of its knowledge type, its representation and \\ninterpretation.  \\n3.1 Knowledge Based MT  \\n“The term knowledge based MT has come to describe a system displaying extensive semantic and \\npragmatic knowledge of domain, including an ability to reason to some limited extent, about concepts in the \\ndomain.”  \\nThe basic aim of KBMT is to obtain high quality output in a specific domain with no post-editing work. \\nThe KBMT systems are generally domain specific, especially a domain that is less ambiguous, like technical \\ndocuments. The reason for it to be domain specific is that representing complete knowledge of the whole world is \\nvery difficult. The domain model is used to represent the meaning of the source language text. The basic \\ncomponents of a KBMT system are:-  \\n1. Ontology of the domain, which serves as an intermediate representation during translation. It usually includes \\nthe set of distinct objects resulting from an analysis of a domain.  \\n2. Source language lexicon and grammar for the analysis.  \\n3. Target language lexicon and grammar for the generation.  \\n4. The mapping rules between the intermediate and source/target language.  \\nFor example, the KANT system developed by CMT at Carnegie Mellon University is a practical translation \\nsystem for technical documentation from English to Japanese, French and German [3].  \\n \\n3.2 Statistical MT  \\nThe model works with the intuition that the translated sentence has been passed through a noisy channel, \\nwhich distorted the source sentence S to the translated sentence T. To recover the original source sentence we \\nneed to calculate the following –  \\n1. The probability of getting the original sentence S in the source language.  \\n2. The probability of getting the translated sentence T in the target language.  \\nThese are known as Language model and Translation model respectively [6]. We assign to every pair of sentence \\n(S, T) a joi nt probability, which is the product of the probability Pr(S) computed by the language model and the \\nconditional probability Pr(T/S) computed by translation model. We choose that sentence in the source language \\nfor which the probability Pr(S/T) is maximum. Using Bayes theorem, we can write  \\nPr (S/T) = (Pr (S) * Pr (T/S)) / Pr (T)  \\nwhere Pr (S/T) = probability that the decoder will produce S when presented with T, Pr(T/S) = probability that the \\ntranslator will produce T when presented with S  \\n \\n3.3 Example Based MT  \\nEBMT is a corpus based machine translation, which requires parallel -aligned 3 machine -readable \\ncorpora. Here, the already translated example serves as knowledge to the system. This approach derives the \\ninformation from the corpora for analysis, tra nsfer and generation of translation. These systems take the source \\ntext and find the most analogous examples from the source examples in the corpora. The next step is to retrieve \\ncorresponding translations. And the final step is to recombine the retrieved translations into the final translation.  \\nNagao (1984) was the first to introduce the idea of translation by analogy and claimed that the linguistic data are \\nmore reliable than linguistic theories. In EBMT, instead of using explicit mapping rules for trans lating sentences \\nfrom one language to another, the translation process is basically a procedure for matching the input sentence \\nagainst the stored translated examples. Figure 7 shows the architecture of a pure EBMT [7].'),\n",
